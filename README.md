# Terraform Module for Vault Keycloak Terraform Provider

Support module for our [keycloak vault secret backend](https://github.com/Serviceware/vault-plugin-secrets-keycloak) and its [support terraform provider Serviceware/vaultkeycloak](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Serviceware/vaultkeycloak/latest). 
It provisions keycloak with the required client id and role so vault can talk to the this realm and access the client secrets.

```hcl

module "keycloak_vault_config" {

  source = "Serviceware/vaultkeycloak/keycloak-client"
  realm           = "my-realm"
  vault_client_id = "vault"

  vault_client_secret = "vault123" //optional, usually generated by keycloak it self
}

```
